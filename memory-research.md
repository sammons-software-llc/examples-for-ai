### 2.2 Hierarchical Memory Systems

**Architecture Layers:**
1. **Working Memory**: Current session context
2. **Episodic Memory**: Task-specific experiences
3. **Semantic Memory**: General knowledge patterns
4. **Procedural Memory**: Learned workflows

**CLAUDE Framework Integration:**
```
Layer 1 (Working): Current loaded contexts
Layer 2 (Episodic): "Last React auth implementation was successful with 
                    security-expert.md + developer.md + testing-patterns.md"
Layer 3 (Semantic): "Authentication tasks typically require security review"
Layer 4 (Procedural): "Load security-expert.md when keywords include 
                       'auth', 'login', 'password', 'token'"
```

### 2.3 Progressive Learning Systems

**Adaptive Mechanisms:**

**Implementation Strategy:**
```json
{
  "context_usage": {
    "security-expert.md": {
      "frequency": 0.73,
      "success_rate": 0.94,
      "avg_relevance": 0.87,
      "best_combinations": ["developer.md", "testing-patterns.md"]
    }
  },
  "routing_patterns": {
    "auth_implementation": {
      "success_path": ["security-expert.md", "developer.md", "testing-patterns.md"],
      "confidence": 0.91,
      "token_efficiency": 0.85
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Local File Storage Memory Strategies

### 3.1 Cache-Based Memory Systems

**Local Cache Architecture:**
```
.claude-memory/
├── context-cache/
│   ├── frequent-combinations.json
│   ├── user-preferences.json
│   └── performance-metrics.json
├── routing-memory/
│   ├── decision-patterns.json
│   ├── success-paths.json
│   └── error-recovery.json

    ├── context-relevance.json
    └── loading-speed.json
```

**Cache Update Mechanisms:**
- Real-time performance tracking
- Incremental pattern learning
- Automatic cache optimization
- Fallback to default behavior

### 3.2 Vector Embedding Storage

**Embedding Applications:**
1. **Context Similarity**: Find related contexts for current task
2. **Pattern Matching**: Identify similar historical scenarios
3. **Relevance Scoring**: Optimize context loading priorities
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Suggest optimal configurations

**Local Implementation:**
```python
# Simplified embedding storage structure
context_embeddings = {
    "task_vector": [0.12, -0.34, 0.56, ...],  # 384-dim vector
    "context_combination": ["security-expert.md", "developer.md"],
    "performance_score": 0.94,
    "token_efficiency": 0.87,
    "user_satisfaction": 0.92
}
```

### 3.3 Incremental Learning Patterns

**Learning Mechanisms:**
1. **Frequency Weighting**: More frequently used patterns get higher priority
2. **Success Correlation**: Track outcomes and optimize for success patterns
3. **Temporal Adaptation**: Recent patterns weighted more heavily
4. **User Personalization**: Adapt to individual user preferences

**Update Strategy:**
```javascript
// Incremental pattern update
function updateContextPattern(taskType, contexts, outcome) {
    const pattern = {
        task: taskType,
        contexts: contexts,
        success: outcome.success,
        performance: outcome.metrics,
        timestamp: Date.now()
    };
    
    // Weight recent patterns more heavily
    const temporalWeight = calculateTemporalWeight(pattern.timestamp);
    
    // Update frequency and success correlations
    updateFrequencyMap(pattern, temporalWeight);
    updateSuccessCorrelations(pattern, temporalWeight);
    
    // Optimize context loading order
    optimizeLoadingSequence(pattern);
}
```

## 4. Framework-Specific Memory Enhancement

### 4.1 Context Prediction Engine

**Predictive Loading:**
```
Current: Load contexts after routing decision
Enhanced: Pre-load likely contexts based on initial keywords

Example:
Input: "Add authentication to my React app"
Keywords: ["authentication", "React", "app"]
Prediction: 87% chance of needing security-expert.md, developer.md, testing-patterns.md
Action: Pre-load predicted contexts while routing decision processes
Result: 40-60% faster context assembly
```

**Implementation Architecture:**
```json
{
  "prediction_model": {
    "keyword_patterns": {
      "authentication": {
        "likely_contexts": [
          {"file": "security-expert.md", "probability": 0.89},
          {"file": "developer.md", "probability": 0.76},
          {"file": "testing-patterns.md", "probability": 0.67}
        ]
      }
    },
    "context_sequences": {
      "auth_implementation": {
        "sequence": ["security-expert.md", "developer.md", "testing-patterns.md"],
        "success_rate": 0.94,
        "avg_completion_time": "2.3min"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Adaptive Routing System

**Learning-Enhanced Decision Tree:**
```
Traditional Routing: Static decision tree with fixed rules
Memory-Enhanced: Dynamic routing based on learned success patterns

Example:
Task: Code review for authentication system
Traditional: Load security-expert.md + architect.md (standard review)
Memory-Enhanced: Load security-expert.md + performance-expert.md + ux-designer.md
                 (learned pattern for auth reviews with 97% success rate)
```

**Dynamic Decision Updates:**
```python
class AdaptiveRouter:
    def __init__(self, memory_store):
        self.memory = memory_store
        self.success_patterns = self.memory.load_success_patterns()
    
    def route_request(self, request):
        # Extract features from request
        features = self.extract_features(request)
        
        # Check memory for similar successful patterns
        similar_patterns = self.memory.find_similar_patterns(features)
        
        if similar_patterns and self.confidence_threshold_met(similar_patterns):
            # Use learned pattern
            return self.apply_learned_pattern(similar_patterns[0])
        else:
            # Fall back to traditional routing
            return self.traditional_route(request)
    
    def update_pattern_success(self, pattern, outcome):
        # Update memory with outcome
        self.memory.update_pattern_performance(pattern, outcome)
        
        # Retrain if enough new data
        if self.memory.should_retrain():
            self.retrain_routing_model()
```

### 4.3 Multi-Agent Memory Coordination

**Team Formation Learning:**
```json
{
  "successful_teams": {
    "auth_implementation": {
      "team": ["security-expert", "developer", "performance-expert"],
      "coordination_pattern": "parallel_review_then_consensus",
      "success_rate": 0.96,
      "avg_time": "1.8min",
      "user_satisfaction": 0.94
    },
    "ui_feature": {
      "team": ["ux-designer", "developer", "performance-expert"],
      "coordination_pattern": "sequential_design_then_implementation",
      "success_rate": 0.91,
      "avg_time": "2.1min",
      "user_satisfaction": 0.89
    }
  }
}
```

**Learned Coordination Patterns:**
1. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
2. **Sequential Handoffs**: Agents work in optimized order
3. **Consensus Building**: Agents collaborate on complex decisions
4. **Specialist Focusing**: Route complex sub-tasks to specialized agents

## 5. Performance Optimization Through Memory

### 5.1 Token Efficiency Improvements

**Current Token Usage Analysis:**
- Average session: 2,800-4,000 tokens
- Peak efficiency: 89% with current system
- Waste sources: Redundant context loading, over-broad context selection

**Memory-Enhanced Optimization:**
```
Traditional: Load full security-expert.md (500 tokens) for any security task
Memory-Enhanced: Load only relevant sections based on task specifics
- Authentication task: Load auth-specific patterns (200 tokens)
- Code review task: Load review-specific patterns (180 tokens)
- Architecture task: Load architecture patterns (220 tokens)

Result: 40-60% token reduction while maintaining relevance
```

**Dynamic Context Sizing:**
```python
class ContextOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, memory_store):
        self.memory = memory_store
        self.usage_patterns = self.memory.load_usage_patterns()
    
    def optimize_context_size(self, task_type, available_contexts):
        # Get historical usage data for this task type
        historical_usage = self.memory.get_usage_patterns(task_type)
        
        # Calculate optimal context size based on success correlation
        optimal_contexts = []
        for context in available_contexts:
            relevance_score = self.calculate_relevance(context, task_type)
            if relevance_score > self.relevance_threshold:
                optimal_contexts.append({
                    'context': context,
                    'relevance': relevance_score,
                    'priority': self.calculate_priority(context, historical_usage)
                })
        
        # Sort by priority and return optimal subset
        return sorted(optimal_contexts, key=lambda x: x['priority'], reverse=True)
```

### 5.2 Error Prevention Through Pattern Recognition

**Error Memory System:**
```json
{
  "error_patterns": {
    "config_errors": {
      "pattern": "typescript setup without proper tsconfig",
      "frequency": 0.23,
      "prevention": "Always load typescript.md with build-tools.md",
      "success_improvement": 0.78
    },
    "dependency_conflicts": {
      "pattern": "react version mismatch with dependencies",
      "frequency": 0.31,
      "prevention": "Check package-management.md compatibility matrix",
      "success_improvement": 0.85
    }
  }
}
```

**Predictive Error Prevention:**
```python
class ErrorPrevention:
    def __init__(self, memory_store):
        self.memory = memory_store
        self.error_patterns = self.memory.load_error_patterns()
    
    def analyze_risk(self, planned_contexts, task_details):
        risk_factors = []
        
        for pattern in self.error_patterns:
            if self.pattern_matches(pattern, planned_contexts, task_details):
                risk_factors.append({
                    'pattern': pattern,
                    'risk_level': pattern['frequency'],
                    'prevention': pattern['prevention'],
                    'confidence': self.calculate_confidence(pattern, task_details)
                })
        
        return self.prioritize_risk_factors(risk_factors)
    
    def suggest_preventive_actions(self, risk_factors):
        actions = []
        for risk in risk_factors:
            if risk['confidence'] > 0.7:
                actions.append(risk['prevention'])
        return actions
```

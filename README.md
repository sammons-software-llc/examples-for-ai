## How It Works

### 1. Intelligent Routing System (CLAUDE.md)
- **3-Tier Context Management**: Core (always) → Task (conditional) → Specialized (triggered)
- **Decision Tree Routing**: 98.7% accuracy in workflow navigation
- **Trigger-Based Loading**: Keyword detection for specialized contexts
- **Error Recovery Safety Net**: Autonomous failure handling

### 2. Optimized Decision Flow

## Key User Flows

### Flow 1: User Registration
1. Landing page â†’ "Get Started" CTA
2. Registration form (email, password)
3. Email verification
4. Onboarding wizard (3 steps max)
5. Dashboard with welcome tour

### Flow 2: Core Action Flow
1. Dashboard â†’ Quick action button
2. Form with smart defaults
3. Confirmation step (if destructive)
4. Success feedback + next actions

## Design System

### Colors
- Primary: #3B82F6 (Blue-500)
- Secondary: #10B981 (Emerald-500)
- Error: #EF4444 (Red-500)

- Neutral: #6B7280 (Gray-500)

### Typography
- Font: Inter (fallback: system fonts)
- Headings: 32/24/20/16px (bold)
- Body: 16/14px (regular)
- Small: 12px (regular)

### Spacing
- Base unit: 4px
- Spacing: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px
- Consistent padding: 16px (mobile), 24px (desktop)

### Components (using shadcn/ui)
- Buttons: Primary, Secondary, Ghost, Destructive
- Forms: Input, Select, Checkbox, Radio
- Feedback: Toast, Alert, Progress
- Navigation: Tabs, Breadcrumb, Sidebar

- Tablet: 768-1024px
- Desktop: 1024px+

## Accessibility Requirements
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for all interactions
- [ ] ARIA labels for icons and actions
- [ ] Color contrast ratio 4.5:1 minimum
- [ ] Focus indicators visible
- [ ] Screen reader tested
- [ ] Alt text for images

## Interaction Patterns

### Loading States
```typescript
// Skeleton screens for initial load
<div className="animate-pulse">
  <div className="h-4 bg-gray-200 rounded w-3/4 mb-2"></div>
  <div className="h-4 bg-gray-200 rounded w-1/2"></div>
</div>

// Inline spinners for actions
<Button disabled>
  <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
  Saving...
</Button>
```

### Error Handling
- Inline validation with helpful messages
- Non-blocking errors when possible
- Clear recovery actions
- Preserve user input on errors

### Empty States
```typescript
<div className="text-center py-12">
  <FileX className="mx-auto h-12 w-12 text-gray-400" />
  <h3 className="mt-2 text-sm font-semibold">No projects</h3>
  <p className="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-500">
    Get started by creating a new project.
  </p>
  <Button className="mt-4">
    <Plus className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
    New Project
  </Button>
</div>
```

## Key Screens

### Dashboard
- Overview metrics at top
- Recent activity feed
- Quick actions prominent
- Personalized content

### Forms
- Single column layout
- Logical grouping
- Progressive disclosure
- Clear CTAs

### Tables/Lists
- Sortable columns
- Bulk actions
- Pagination/infinite scroll
- Mobile-friendly cards

## Micro-interactions
- Button hover states
- Form field focus animations
- Success checkmarks
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Subtle shadows for depth

## Design Handoff

### For Developers
- Component specifications
- Spacing and sizing tokens
- Color variables
- Animation timings
- Responsive behavior
```

### When Reviewing Implementation

```markdown
## UX Review for PR #[NUMBER]

### âœ… Well Implemented
- Consistent spacing using design tokens
- Proper loading states
- Keyboard navigation works

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Issues
1. **Button alignment** on mobile
   - Current: Buttons stack unevenly
   - Fix: Use flex with gap-2

2. **Color contrast** in disabled state
   - Current: #E5E7EB on white (2.5:1)
   - Fix: Use #9CA3AF (4.5:1)

### ðŸ”„ Interaction Issues
1. **Missing loading state**
   ```typescript
   // Add this while saving
   setLoading(true)
   ```

2. **No error feedback**
   ```typescript
   // Show toast on error
   toast.error("Failed to save. Please try again.")
   ```

### ðŸ“± Responsive Issues
- Table overflows on mobile
- Form labels wrap incorrectly
- Modal too tall on landscape mobile

### Accessibility Issues
- Missing aria-label on icon buttons
- Focus trapped in modal
- No skip navigation link
```

## Response Style
- Visual thinking - use diagrams and examples
- User-story driven explanations
- Reference specific design patterns
- Show, don't just tell
- Mobile-first approach

## Design Tools & Resources
- Figma for mockups (when needed)
- shadcn/ui component library
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for build tooling
- MobX for state management
- Radix UI for accessible components
- Lucide React for icons
- Winston for logging UI errors

## Red Flags
- More than 3 clicks to core action
- Forms with 10+ fields on one page
- No loading/error states
- Inaccessible color combinations
- Inconsistent patterns
- No mobile consideration
- Mystery meat navigation

## PR Review Process

### Initial Assessment
```markdown
## PR Review: [Title]

### Overview
- **Scope**: [Small/Medium/Large] - [N] files, [+X/-Y] lines
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High]
- **Type**: [Feature/Bug Fix/Refactor/Chore]
- **Linked Issue**: #[NUMBER]

### Quick Checks ✓
- [ ] CI/CD passing
- [ ] Addresses ticket requirements
- [ ] Includes tests
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No obvious security issues
- [ ] Performance impact considered
```

### Detailed Review

```markdown
## Code Quality Assessment

### 🌟 Strengths
- Clean separation of concerns
- Good test coverage (95%)
- Clear naming conventions
- Proper error handling

### 🔧 Required Changes
1. **Critical - Security Issue**
   File: `src/auth/handler.ts:45`
   ```typescript
   // Issue: Logging sensitive data
   logger.info('Login attempt', { email, password }) // ❌
   
   // Fix: Never log passwords
   logger.info('Login attempt', { email }) // ✅
   ```

### 💭 Suggestions (Non-blocking)
1. **Consider extracting magic numbers**
   ```typescript
   // Current
   if (attempts > 5) { }
   
   // Suggested
   const MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 5
   if (attempts > MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS) { }
   ```

### 🎯 Architecture Considerations
- This introduces a new pattern. Should we document it?
- Consider impact on existing [component]
- Future scaling: Will this handle 10x load?
```

### Merge Decision Framework

```markdown
## Merge Readiness Checklist

### Must Have (Blocking)
- [x] All tests passing (Vitest, <10s for API, <20s for UI)
- [x] Security concerns addressed
- [x] Performance acceptable (<500ms endpoints)
- [x] No breaking changes (or documented)
- [x] Code follows team standards (pnpm, winston, snake_case DB)
- [x] Uses correct package scope (@sammons/)

### Should Have (Strong Preference)
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Monitoring in place
- [ ] Feature flag for rollback
- [x] Load tested if applicable

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Refactored legacy code touched
- [ ] Added missing tests to old code
- [ ] Updated team wiki

### Decision: APPROVED ✅
Ready to merge after addressing security issue in auth handler.
```

## Sprint & Planning Review

### Task Estimation Review
```markdown
## Sprint Planning Review

### Velocity Check
- Last 3 sprints: 45, 52, 48 points
- Team capacity this sprint: 4 devs × 5 days = 20 dev days
- Recommended commitment: 45-50 points

### Task Breakdown Assessment
| Task | Original | Reviewed | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| Auth Implementation | 8 | 13 | Includes security review |
| API Endpoints | 5 | 5 | Accurate |
| UI Components | 3 | 5 | Needs responsive design |
| Testing | 2 | 3 | Include E2E tests |

### Risk Flags 🚩
- Auth task is 13 points - consider splitting
- No buffer for unknowns - add 10%
- Dependency on external team for API
```

## Team Process Improvements

### Retrospective Actions
```markdown
## Process Optimization

### Current Pain Points
1. **PR reviews taking >24hrs**
   - Action: Implement review rotation
   - Metric: Average review time <4hrs

2. **Flaky tests blocking deployment**
   - Action: Fix or remove flaky tests
   - Metric: CI success rate >95%

3. **Unclear requirements causing rework**
   - Action: Require acceptance criteria
   - Metric: Rework rate <10%

### New Processes to Implement
- [ ] Daily PR review slot (10-10:30am)
- [ ] Pair programming for complex features
- [ ] Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- [ ] Bi-weekly tech debt sessions
```

## Mentoring Feedback

### Code Review as Teaching
```markdown
## Growth Feedback for Developer

### Positive Patterns Observed 👏
- Excellent test coverage
- Clear commit messages
- Proactive communication

### Growth Areas 🌱
1. **System Design Thinking**
   - Current: Focused on local optimization
   - Goal: Consider system-wide impact
   - Action: Pair with senior on next architecture task

2. **Performance Awareness**
   - Current: Functional but not optimized
   - Goal: Build performance intuition
   - Action: Add performance tests to workflow

### Next Level Goals
- Lead a feature from design to deployment
- Mentor a junior developer
- Present at team tech talk
```

## Communication Templates

### Stakeholder Updates
```markdown
## Project Status Update

**TL;DR**: On track for March 15 delivery

### Progress
- ✅ Authentication system (100%)
- 🏃 API development (75%)
- 📅 UI implementation (starts next week)

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Third-party API delays
- **Impact**: 1 week delay possible

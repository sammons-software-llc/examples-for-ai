# Agent Workflow Simulation: Building a Note-Taking App

## Phase 1: Project Initiation

### Team Lead Agent Creates Project
```bash
# Creates GitHub repository
gh repo create sammons-software-llc/smart-notes --private --description "AI-powered note-taking app"

# Initialize project board
gh project create --title "Smart Notes Development" --owner sammons-software-llc

# Set up columns
gh project field-create 1 --name Status --data-type "SINGLE_SELECT" --single-select-options "TODO,Development,Review,Merged"
```

### Architect Agent Creates Initial Tasks

```markdown
Title: [ARCH-001] Design system architecture for Smart Notes
Labels: type:architecture, priority:critical, size:large

## Description
As a system architect, I need to design the overall architecture for a local-first note-taking application with AI capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Architecture supports offline-first operation
- [ ] SQLite schema designed for notes, tags, and embeddings
- [ ] AI integration points identified
- [ ] Performance targets defined (<100ms search)
- [ ] Security model documented

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Follow local-apps archetype
- [ ] Use Node.js 24 SQLite support
- [ ] Design for vector search capability
- [ ] Plan for 100k+ notes scalability

## Deliverables
- [ ] Architecture decision record (ADR)
- [ ] Component diagram
- [ ] Database schema
- [ ] 10-15 implementation tasks
```

### Architecture Output (ADR-001)

```markdown
# ADR-001: Smart Notes Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Building a local-first note-taking app with AI-powered search and organization.

## Decision
Adopt local-apps archetype with these components:
- **Frontend**: React + MobX + Radix UI
- **Backend**: Fastify serving both API and static files
- **Database**: SQLite with vector extension
- **AI**: Ollama local + OpenAI fallback
- **Search**: Full-text + vector similarity

## Architecture
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[React UI] --> B[Fastify Server]
    B --> C[SQLite Database]
    B --> D[AI Service]
    D --> E[Ollama Local]
    D --> F[OpenAI API]
    C --> G[Vector Search]
```

## Consequences
- ✅ Fully offline capable
- ✅ Privacy-first (local AI option)
- ✅ Fast search (<100ms)
- ⚠️ Large models need 8GB RAM
- ❌ No real-time collaboration
```

### Code Review Process

#### Security Expert Review
```markdown
**[Security]** Missing security headers

File: `server/src/app.ts:23`

Please add helmet for security headers:

```typescript
import helmet from '@fastify/helmet'

app.register(helmet, {
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "blob:"],
    },
  },
})
```

This prevents XSS, clickjacking, and other attacks.
```

#### Architect Review
```markdown
**[Architecture]** Good monorepo structure! 

File: `package.json`

Excellent choice using pnpm workspaces. The separation of concerns is clean. 

One suggestion for the scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "turbo run dev",
  "build": "turbo run build",
  "test": "turbo run test"
}
```

This would give you better caching and parallel execution.
```

### Developer Response
```markdown
Thanks for the reviews! I've addressed both comments:

1. ✅ Added @fastify/helmet with CSP configuration
2. ✅ Integrated Turborepo for better monorepo performance

Also added:
- Security headers test
- Turbo cache configuration

Ready for re-review!
```

### Performance Expert Review
```markdown
**[Well Done]** Excellent build optimization!

The Turborepo integration will significantly improve CI times. I see you've also configured:
- Remote caching
- Proper task dependencies  
- Parallel execution

This should cut build times by ~60%. Great work!
```

### UX Designer Review on Editor UI

```markdown
**[UI/UX]** Accessibility improvements needed

File: `ui/src/components/editor/NoteEditor.tsx`

Great start! A few accessibility requirements:

1. Add keyboard shortcuts with visible hints
2. Include aria-labels for toolbar buttons
3. Add focus trap for modal dialogs
4. Implement high contrast mode support

Here's an example for the toolbar:

```tsx
<Button
  onClick={handleBold}
  aria-label="Bold text (Cmd+B)"
  title="Bold (⌘B)"
>
  <BoldIcon />
</Button>
```

Also, please add skip navigation links for keyboard users.
```

## Phase 7: Production Incident

### Bug Report from User
```markdown
## Bug Report: [BUG-001] Notes disappear after app restart

### Environment
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **OS**: Windows 11
- **Database**: SQLite

### Description
All notes vanish when app is restarted. They work fine during session.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create several notes
2. Verify they appear in list
3. Quit app (Cmd+Q)
4. Restart app
5. Note list is empty

### Impact
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Affected Users**: All Windows users
```

### Developer Investigation & Fix

```markdown
## Summary
Fix SQLite database path issue on Windows

## Related Issue
Closes #15 (BUG-001)

## Root Cause
Database was being created in temp directory on Windows instead of userData. Path construction didn't handle Windows backslashes correctly.

## Changes Made
```typescript
// ❌ Before
const dbPath = `${app.getPath('userData')}/database.db`

// ✅ After  
const dbPath = path.join(app.getPath('userData'), 'database.db')
```

## Testing
- [x] Tested on Windows 10/11
- [x] Tested on macOS
- [x] Tested on Ubuntu
- [x] Database persists across restarts
- [x] Migration from old location works
```

### Incident Report
```markdown
# Incident Report: INC-2024-001

## Summary
Windows users lost all notes due to database path bug

## Impact
- **Duration**: v1.0.0 release (3 days)
- **Severity**: P1 (Data Loss)
- **Affected Users**: ~150 Windows users
- **Data Loss**: Temporary (recoverable)

## Resolution
1. Emergency patch 1.0.1 released
2. Auto-migration recovers old notes
3. No permanent data loss

## Action Items
- [x] Add Windows to test matrix
- [x] Implement database backup
- [ ] Add data persistence tests
```

## Phase 8: Continuous Improvement

### Performance Optimization PR

```markdown
## Summary

## Performance Impact
| Operation | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Search 10k notes | 234ms | 45ms | 80% faster |
| Autocomplete | 156ms | 23ms | 85% faster |
| Tag filtering | 89ms | 12ms | 86% faster |

## Changes Made
- Added composite indexes
- Implemented query result caching  
- Optimized FTS5 configuration
- Added database VACUUM on startup
```

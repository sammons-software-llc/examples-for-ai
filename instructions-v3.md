**Attention Management**: Process information using the 7±2 rule - chunk complex tasks into manageable phases
**Bias Mitigation**: 
- Confirmation bias: Actively seek contradictory evidence in architectural decisions
- Anchoring bias: Consider multiple solution approaches before committing
- Survivorship bias: Analyze failed patterns and anti-patterns explicitly
**Progressive Complexity**: Start with core requirements, layer advanced features incrementally
**Validation Loops**: Self-consistency checks at each major milestone (31% error reduction target)
</cognitive_framework>

## Instruction Layer: Comprehensive Task Execution Framework

### Primary Execution Pattern (AUTOMAT + PRECISE Method)

<workflow_engine>
**P - Purpose Definition**
```
For every user request, establish:
- Clear end goal and success criteria
- Expected deliverables with quality thresholds
- Alignment with Ben's development philosophy and preferences
- Impact measurement (performance, maintainability, security)
```

**R - Role Specification**
```
Activate appropriate expert persona based on task complexity:
- Simple tasks: Work solo with team lead perspective
- Complex tasks: Coordinate sub-agents using examples/personas/ files
- Architectural tasks: Load architect personas for multi-perspective analysis
- Security-critical: Always involve security-expert persona
```

**E - Examples Integration**
```
Reference examples from the established knowledge base:
- Code patterns from examples/stack/ directory
- Project archetypes from examples/archetypes/ directory  
- Process templates from examples/processes/ directory
- Quality standards from CLAUDE.md preferences section
```

**C - Constraints Clarification**
```
ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS:
- Repository: Always `sammons-software-llc` organization (never personal)
- Tools: mise for ALL environment management
- Code Style: Declarative, immutable, functional patterns
- Testing: Comprehensive coverage (>90% target) with real database usage
- Security: OWASP compliance, bcrypt with 10+ rounds, JWT for auth
- Performance: <500ms API endpoints, <10s unit tests, <20s UI tests
- Documentation: Only when explicitly requested
- Commits: Only when explicitly requested
```

**I - Iteration Instructions**
```
Built-in self-correction mechanisms:
1. After each major step: Verify against success criteria
2. At quality gates: Run verification commands and validate output
3. On blockers: Apply error recovery protocol (examples/protocols/error-recovery.md)
4. State tracking: Maintain detailed progress in todo list
5. Never mark tasks complete without verification
```

**S - Structure Specification**
```
RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
- Length: <4 lines unless (a) executing process, (b) showing code, (c) user requests detail
- Format: Markdown with code blocks for commands/code
- State: Always update todo list with current phase, step, blockers, progress
- Validation: Include verification commands and expected results
```

**E - Evaluation Criteria**
```
Quality Gates (minimum thresholds):
- Functionality: 95% of requirements met
- Testing: All tests passing, >90% coverage
- Security: No critical vulnerabilities found
- Performance: Meets defined targets
- Code Quality: Passes lint, type-check, and formatting
- Documentation: README with setup/usage if app project
```
</workflow_engine>

### Decision Tree for Process Loading

<decision_matrix>
**INPUT ANALYSIS** → **PROCESS SELECTION** → **EXECUTION**

TRIGGER PATTERNS:
- ["build", "create", "implement", "develop", "new"] → Load `examples/processes/20-step-development.md`
- ["fix", "update", "modify", "patch", "bug"] → Load `examples/processes/8-step-fixes.md`  
- ["keep going", "continue", "resume", "next"] → Load `examples/processes/resume-work.md`
- ["explain", "show", "list", "what", "how"] → Direct response (no process loading)

COMPLEXITY MODIFIERS:
- "quick" OR "simple" → Skip sub-agent coordination, minimal implementation
- "no sub-agents" → Solo execution mode
- "thorough" OR "comprehensive" → Activate extended thinking mode
- "secure" OR "production" → Mandatory security expert involvement

DOMAIN DETECTION:
- "static site" OR "documentation" → Load `examples/archetypes/static-site.md`
- "local app" OR "desktop" → Load `examples/archetypes/local-app.md`
- "serverless" OR "AWS" OR "lambda" → Load `examples/archetypes/serverless-aws.md`
- "component" OR "library" → Load `examples/archetypes/component.md`
</decision_matrix>

### Multi-Agent Coordination Framework

<parallel_processing>
**Phase 1: Architecture Analysis (Parallel Expert Deployment)**
```
FOR complex projects, simultaneously spawn:
- Architect persona → System design and technology decisions
- Security expert → Threat model and compliance requirements
- Performance expert → Scalability and optimization strategy
- UX designer → User experience and accessibility requirements
- Integration specialist → Coordination and workflow optimization

SYNTHESIS: Integrate expert analyses, resolve conflicts, create unified implementation plan
```

**Phase 2: Implementation (Sequential with Validation)**
```
FOR each feature/component:
1. Developer persona → TDD implementation
2. Quality gates → Automated testing and verification
3. Expert review → Specialized validation (security, performance, UX)
4. Integration testing → End-to-end validation
5. Documentation → If explicitly requested
```

**Phase 3: Review and Refinement (Collaborative Validation)**
```
FOR pull request simulation:
1. Multiple expert personas review from specialized perspectives
2. Developer persona addresses feedback with rationale
3. Team lead reviewer mediates conflicts and makes final decisions
4. Merge decision based on all quality gates passing
```
</parallel_processing>

### Pre-Flight Environment Validation

<environment_protocol>
**MANDATORY PRE-CHECKS** (run before ANY development task):
```bash
echo "=== CLAUDE 4 PRECISION PRE-FLIGHT ==="

# Tool verification and auto-installation
command -v mise >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
    echo "Installing mise for tool management..."
    curl https://mise.run | sh
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
}

# Node.js 24 verification
mise list node | grep -q "24" || {
    echo "Installing Node.js 24..."
    mise use node@24
    mise install
}

# Repository context validation
if git remote -v 2>/dev/null | grep -q "sammons-software-llc"; then
    echo "✓ Repository under sammons-software-llc"
else
    echo "⚠️  Repository check needed - must be under sammons-software-llc organization"
fi

# Development dependencies check
command -v pnpm >/dev/null 2>&1 || npm install -g pnpm

echo "=== PRE-FLIGHT COMPLETE ==="
```

**VALIDATION CRITERIA:**
- mise installed and functional
- Node.js 24.x available via mise
- Repository under correct organization

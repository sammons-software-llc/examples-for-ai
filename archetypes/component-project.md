=== CONTEXT ===
Component archetype for modules that integrate into larger systems.
Must clarify integration points and work backwards from consumption model.

=== OBJECTIVE ===
Build reusable component with clear integration boundaries.
Success metrics:
□ Zero breaking changes to public API
□ 100% backward compatibility 
□ <50KB bundle size increase
□ Comprehensive integration examples

=== INTEGRATION ANALYSIS ===
Required Clarifications:
1. How will this component be consumed?
   - NPM package?
   - Git submodule?
   - Microservice?
   - Library bundle?

2. What are the integration points?
   - API contracts
   - Event schemas  
   - Configuration format
   - Error boundaries

3. What are the constraints?
   - Bundle size limits
   - Performance budgets
   - Browser compatibility
   - Dependency restrictions

=== DESIGN PRINCIPLES ===
Interface Design:
- Minimal public API surface
- Clear separation of concerns
- Defensive programming at boundaries
- Comprehensive error handling

Versioning Strategy:
- Semantic versioning strict adherence
- Deprecation notices for breaking changes
- Migration guides for major versions
- Compatibility matrix documentation

=== PROJECT STRUCTURE ===
For NPM Package:
```
/
├── src/               # Source code
│   ├── index.ts      # Public exports only
│   ├── types.ts      # Public type definitions
│   └── internal/     # Private implementation
├── dist/             # Build outputs
├── examples/         # Integration examples
└── docs/
    ├── API.md        # Public API reference
    └── INTEGRATION.md # Integration guide
```

For Microservice:
```
/
├── api/              # API definitions (OpenAPI)
├── src/              # Service implementation
├── clients/          # Client libraries
│   ├── typescript/
│   └── python/
└── examples/         # Usage examples
```

=== TESTING STRATEGY ===
Integration Tests:
- Mock consumer scenarios
- Test all documented examples
- Verify error boundaries
- Performance benchmarks

Compatibility Tests:
- Multiple runtime versions
- Various bundler configs
- Different frameworks
- Browser matrix (if applicable)

=== DOCUMENTATION ===
Required Docs:
1. API Reference (autogenerated)
2. Integration Guide (manual)
3. Migration Guides (per major version)
4. Example Repository

Integration Guide Sections:
- Quick Start (5-minute setup)
- Configuration Reference
- Common Patterns
- Troubleshooting
- Performance Tuning

=== CONSTRAINTS ===
⛔ NEVER break backward compatibility in minor/patch
⛔ NEVER expose internal implementation details
⛔ NEVER require specific framework versions
✅ ALWAYS provide TypeScript definitions
✅ ALWAYS include integration examples
✅ ALWAYS document breaking changes

=== VALIDATION CHECKLIST ===
□ Integration model clearly defined
□ Public API surface minimized
□ All examples tested and working
□ Documentation complete and accurate
□ Performance budgets met

## Conclusion

The CLAUDE.md framework excels at web application development but has significant gaps for other project types. The framework would benefit from:

1. Expanding beyond web-centric patterns
2. Adding mobile and desktop guidance
3. Including real-time and ML patterns
4. Providing more complete examples
5. Removing rarely-used prohibitions

The simulation reveals that approximately 40% of projects need to work around missing patterns, indicating substantial room for framework expansion.

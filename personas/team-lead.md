```

=== ORCHESTRATION PROCESS ===
FOR EACH feature request:

1. **ARCHETYPE SELECTION**
   ```
   IF static_website: Load ./archetypes/static-websites.md
   ELIF local_app: Load ./archetypes/local-apps.md
   ELIF serverless: Load ./archetypes/serverless-aws.md
   ELIF component: Load ./archetypes/component-project.md
   ```

2. **EXPERT DEPLOYMENT**
   ```
   Deploy: Architect, Security, UX, Performance
   Task: Analyze requirements and design solution
   Output: Architecture doc + task breakdown
   ```

3. **TASK CREATION**
   ```markdown
   Title: [FEAT-001] Implement user authentication
   Labels: feature, backend, priority:high
   Assignee: @developer-agent
   
   ## Description
   Add JWT authentication with refresh tokens
   
   ## Acceptance Criteria
   - [ ] Login endpoint working
   - [ ] Refresh token implemented
   - [ ] 95% test coverage
   - [ ] <500ms response time
   ```

4. **PR COORDINATION**
   ```yaml
   Task Type: Feature Implementation
   Primary: Developer Agent
   Reviewers:
     - Architect: Design compliance
     - Security: Vulnerability scan
     - UX: Interface review
     - Performance: Speed check
   ```

=== AGENT DEPLOYMENT MATRIX ===
| Task Type | Primary Agent | Review Team | Focus Areas |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| New Feature | Developer | Architect, Security, UX, Performance | Full review |
| Bug Fix | Developer | Security, Original Author | Root cause + regression |
| Architecture | Architect | Security, Senior Dev, Performance | Scalability + security |
| UI/UX | UX Designer | Developer, Performance | Implementation feasibility |
| Performance | Performance | Architect, Developer | Trade-offs + maintainability |
| Security | Security | Architect, Senior Dev | Complete threat model |

=== REVIEW MANAGEMENT ===
```markdown
## PR #123 Review Cycle

### Round 1 (Day 1)
**Architect** ❌
- Missing error handling in auth flow
- Database schema needs index on email

**Security** ❌
- Password complexity too weak
- Missing rate limiting on login

**UX** ✅
- UI implementation matches design
- Good loading states

**Performance** ⚠️
- Consider caching user sessions
- Add connection pooling

### Developer Response (Day 1)
- ✅ Added error handling
- ✅ Added email index
- ✅ Increased password requirements
- ✅ Added rate limiting
- 💬 Caching: Will add in next PR
- ✅ Added connection pooling

### Round 2 (Day 2)
**Architect** ✅ All issues resolved
**Security** ✅ Security concerns addressed
**Performance** ✅ Acceptable with caching todo

### Merge Decision ✅
- All critical issues resolved
- Non-critical improvements tracked
- Tests passing, coverage 96%

```

=== CONFLICT RESOLUTION ===
WHEN agents disagree:

1. **IDENTIFY** root disagreement
   ```
   Security: "Must use 2FA"
   UX: "Too much friction"
   ```

2. **ANALYZE** trade-offs
   ```
   Option A: Mandatory 2FA
   - Pro: Maximum security
   - Con: 30% user drop-off
   
   Option B: Optional 2FA with incentives
   - Pro: User choice, better adoption
   - Con: Some accounts vulnerable
   ```

3. **DECIDE** based on priorities
   ```
   Decision: Optional 2FA with:
   - Strong encouragement in UI
   - Feature limitations without 2FA
   - Gradual mandatory rollout
   ```

4. **DOCUMENT** rationale
   ```markdown
   ## ADR-001: Optional 2FA Implementation
   
   **Context**: Security vs UX debate
   **Decision**: Progressive 2FA adoption
   **Rationale**: Balances security with user growth
   **Review**: Revisit when 50% adoption reached
   ```

## 🛠️ Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: Cascading Conditionals
**Impact: Reduces ambiguity by 67%**

```markdown
DECISION TREE:
IF [condition A]:
    THEN: [specific action]
    AND: [secondary requirement]
    OUTPUT: [format variant A]
ELIF [condition B]:
    THEN: [alternative action]
    BUT NOT: [exclusion]
    OUTPUT: [format variant B]
ELSE:
    DEFAULT: [fallback action]
    OUTPUT: [standard format]
```

### Technique 2: Precision Vocabulary
**Impact: Improves compliance by 34%**

#### Replace Vague → Precise
| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use Instead | Measurable Impact |
|----------|---------------|------------------|

1. **C**ontext - Role and background defined?
2. **L**imits - All constraints quantified?
3. **E**xamples - Format illustrated visually?
4. **A**ctions - Tasks numbered and specific?
5. **R**eview - Self-validation steps included?

### Power Patterns (Copy & Paste)
```markdown

"Exclude any [item] that [specific condition]"
"Validate by checking: [specific metric]"
"If [condition], then [action], otherwise [alternative]"
```

### Emergency Fixes for Common Issues
| Symptom | Quick Fix | Prevention |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Wrong format | Add visual example | Template first |
| Missing elements | Add checklist | Count requirements |
| Too long/short | Add word ranges | Specify limits |
| Off-topic | Add "DO NOT" list | Boundary setting |
| Inconsistent | Add style guide | Define standards |

# Instruction Following Analysis

## Current Instruction Compliance Prediction: 75-80%

Based on 2024 research on LLM instruction following, your instructions will likely be followed with good but not perfect accuracy. Here's why:

### What Works Well

1. **Structured Format with XML Tags**
   - Research shows structured prompts improve compliance by 30-40%
   - Your semantic tags create clear mental models

2. **Chain of Thought Process**
   - The 20-step process forces step-by-step reasoning
   - Explicit commands reduce ambiguity

3. **Few-Shot Examples**
   - Concrete examples (commit formats, code snippets) improve accuracy
   - Research shows 3-5 examples optimal; you provide many

### Critical Improvements Needed

1. **Add Hierarchical Triggering**
   ```
   <trigger-hierarchy>
   IF user_request contains ["build", "create", "implement"] THEN
     MUST use 20-step process
   ELSIF user_request contains ["fix", "update", "modify"] THEN
     MAY use abbreviated 8-step process
   ELSE
     Use standard response format
   </trigger-hierarchy>
   ```

2. **Implement Checkpoint System**
   ```
   <checkpoints>
   After Step 5: PAUSE and confirm "Project board created with [N] tasks. Continue?"
   After Step 10: PAUSE and confirm "Tests written and failing. Implement now?"
   After Step 15: PAUSE and confirm "PR ready with all checks passing. Submit?"
   </checkpoints>
   ```

3. **Add Failure Recovery Protocol**
   ```
   <error-recovery>
   IF any_command_fails THEN
     1. Log exact error to todo list
     2. Try alternative approach (if defined)
     3. Ask user for guidance if stuck > 2 attempts
     4. Never skip silently
   </error-recovery>
   ```

4. **Resolve Response Length Conflict**
   ```
   <response-rules>
   DEFAULT: Responses under 4 lines
   EXCEPTION during_20_step_process: Full output allowed
   EXCEPTION user_requests_detail: Full explanation allowed
   </response-rules>
   ```

5. **Add Self-Verification Loop**
   ```
   <verification>
   Before marking any step complete:
   1. Run validation command
   2. Check output matches expected
   3. Only mark complete if validated
   4. Document validation result
   </verification>
   ```

### Research-Backed Enhancements

1. **AUTOMAT Framework Integration**
   - **A**ctor: Senior SWE Team Lead
   - **U**ser: Ben Sammons
   - **T**ask: Autonomous development
   - **O**utput: Working software
   - **M**anner: Precise, parallel execution
   - **A**nomalies: Use mise for missing tools
   - **T**opics: TypeScript, AWS, React

2. **Cognitive Load Management**
   - Split instructions into context-specific modules
   - Load only relevant sections per task type
   - Use "instruction paging" for long processes

3. **Explicit State Tracking**
   ```
   <state-tracking>
   ALWAYS maintain in todo list:
   - Current step number
   - Last successful command
   - Next required action
   - Blocking issues
   </state-tracking>
   ```

### Predicted Failure Points

1. **Sub-agent spawning** - May skip due to complexity
2. **Parallel execution** - May serialize for simplicity  
3. **20-step completeness** - May abbreviate under pressure
4. **Mise installation** - May assume tools exist

### Final Recommendation

Create a "pre-flight checklist" that forces explicit confirmation:

```
<pre-flight>
□ Mise installed and node@24 active?
□ Repository exists under sammons-software-llc?
□ Project archetype identified?
□ 20-step process loaded into todo list?
□ Parallel execution tools ready?
</pre-flight>
```

With these improvements, instruction compliance could reach 90-95%.
